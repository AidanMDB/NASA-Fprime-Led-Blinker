# led-blinker F' project

This project was auto-generated by the F' utility tool. 

F´ (F Prime) is a component-driven framework that enables rapid development and deployment of spaceflight and other embedded software applications.
**Please Visit the F´ Website:** https://fprime.jpl.nasa.gov.


To start editing run command - '. fprime-venv/bin/activate'
this activates the virtual-enviorement

for running cross compiler if getting error related to being unable to find binaries might have to run 
'export PATH=/opt/toolchains/bin:$PATH'



To run the LedBlinker application
'./LedBlinker -a 0.0.0.0 -p 5000'

If its gets stuck or held up open a new ssh session and run
'pkill LedBlinker' -> kills the application process


Within "/LedBlinker/Top/LedBlinkerTopolgy.cpp" make sure "/dev/gpiochip*" is set for the correct pin
BeagleBone has /dev/gpiochip0 -> /dev/gpiochip3       run command gpioinfo to see them all
the '20' represents the line number to provide which can be gotten from gpioinfo
Os::File::Status status = gpioDriver.open("/dev/gpiochip4", 20, Drv::LinuxGpioDriver::GpioConfiguration::GPIO_OUTPUT);
if (status != Os::File::Status::OP_OK) {
    Fw::Logger::log("[ERROR] Failed to open GPIO pin\n");
}


sudo setcap 'cap_sys_nice=eip' ./LedBlinker       ->       allows the software to set higher priority tasks than normally allowed

sudo usermod -aG gpio debian       ->      adds debian user to the gpio group allowing the software to use the gpio pins
